                        What is kemis?
                        Kemis is a traditional Ethiopian dress. Ethiopia has more than eighty ethinic groups. Many of these ethnicities have their own language, clothing and cultural practices. Although the clothing between ethnic communities differs from one another, the Amhara ethnicity (the second largest ethnic group) has the most popular cultural attire. The traditional attire for the Amhara women is called Kemis. Kemis is a white handwoven cotton dress that is worn on special occasions by many Ethiopian women around the world. These white dresses have various designs on them.
